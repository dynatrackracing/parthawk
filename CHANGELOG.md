# DARKHAWK CHANGELOG

Reverse chronological. Every deploy gets one entry. Claude Code appends to this after every session.

## [2026-04-01] Autolumen Multi-Store Integration
- **Added:** `store` column on YourListing and YourSale (default: 'dynatrack')

- **Added:** Collapsible Autolumen Sync card on Nest Protector (gate.html)
- **Added:** DYNATRACK/AUTOLUMEN store badges on stock check results
- **Changed:** YourDataManager deactivation sweep scoped to store='dynatrack'
- **Changed:** StaleInventoryService scoped to store='dynatrack'
- **Changed:** check-stock API now returns `store` field on results
- **Files touched:** migration (new), AutolumenImportService.js (new), routes/autolumen.js (new), YourDataManager.js, cogs.js, gate.html, StaleInventoryService.js, index.js, package.json
